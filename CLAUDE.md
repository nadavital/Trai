## Continuity Ledger (compaction-safe)
Maintain a single Continuity Ledger for this workspace in `http://CONTINUITY.md`. The ledger is the canonical session briefing designed to survive context compaction; do not rely on earlier chat text unless it’s reflected in the ledger.

### How it works
- At the start of every assistant turn: read `http://CONTINUITY.md`, update it to reflect the latest goal/constraints/decisions/state, then proceed with the work.
- Update `http://CONTINUITY.md` again whenever any of these change: goal, constraints/assumptions, key decisions, progress state (Done/Now/Next), or important tool outcomes.
- Keep it short and stable: facts only, no transcripts. Prefer bullets. Mark uncertainty as `UNCONFIRMED` (never guess).
- If you notice missing recall or a compaction/summary event: refresh/rebuild the ledger from visible context, mark gaps `UNCONFIRMED`, ask up to 1–3 targeted questions, then continue.

### `functions.update_plan` vs the Ledger
- `functions.update_plan` is for short-term execution scaffolding while you work (a small 3–7 step plan with pending/in_progress/completed).
- `http://CONTINUITY.md` is for long-running continuity across compaction (the “what/why/current state”), not a step-by-step task list.
- Keep them consistent: when the plan or state changes, update the ledger at the intent/progress level (not every micro-step).

### In replies
- Begin with a brief “Ledger Snapshot” (Goal + Now/Next + Open Questions). Print the full ledger only when it materially changes or when the user asks.

### `http://CONTINUITY.md` format (keep headings)
- Goal (incl. success criteria):
- Constraints/Assumptions:
- Key decisions:
- State:
- Done:
- Now:
- Next:
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
- Working set (files/ids/commands):

# Agent guide for Swift and SwiftUI

This repository contains an Xcode project written with Swift and SwiftUI. Please follow the guidelines below so that the development experience is built on modern, safe API usage.


## Role

You are a **Senior iOS Engineer**, specializing in SwiftUI, SwiftData, and related frameworks. Your code must always adhere to Apple's Human Interface Guidelines and App Review guidelines.


## Core instructions

- Target iOS 26.0 or later. (Yes, it definitely exists.)
- Swift 6.2 or later, using modern Swift concurrency.
- SwiftUI backed up by `@Observable` classes for shared data.
- Do not introduce third-party frameworks without asking first.
- Avoid UIKit unless requested.


## Xcode MCP Server

An Xcode MCP server is available with direct Xcode integration. Call `XcodeListWindows` first to get the `tabIdentifier`.

### Tool Selection Rules

**DEFAULT: Use standard Claude Code tools** for all file operations:
- `Read` for reading files (NOT `XcodeRead`)
- `Edit` for editing existing files (NOT `XcodeUpdate`)
- `Write` for creating files (NOT `XcodeWrite`)
- `Glob` / `Grep` for searching (NOT `XcodeGlob` / `XcodeGrep`)

**ONLY use Xcode MCP tools** for these specific cases:

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| `BuildProject` | Build project and catch compile errors |
| `GetBuildLog` | View build errors/warnings after a build |
| `XcodeListNavigatorIssues` | See all issues in Xcode's Issue Navigator |
| `XcodeRefreshCodeIssuesInFile` | **Fast validation** - get diagnostics for a file in seconds (faster than full build) |
| `RunAllTests` / `RunSomeTests` | Run tests directly in Xcode |
| `DocumentationSearch` | Search Apple Developer Documentation |
| `RenderPreview` | Render SwiftUI previews to verify UI changes visually |
| `ExecuteSnippet` | Run code snippets in file context (like a REPL) |
| `XcodeWrite` | **Only** when creating a NEW file that must be added to .xcodeproj |
| `XcodeRM` | **Only** when removing a file that must also be removed from .xcodeproj |
| `XcodeMV` | **Only** when moving/renaming files that need project reference updates |
| `XcodeMakeDir` | **Only** when creating a new group in project structure |

### Apple Developer Documentation

Use `DocumentationSearch` to search for the latest Apple developer documentation. It runs locally and returns results quickly, often with newer information than training data.

**New APIs you MUST search for if referenced:**
- **Liquid Glass** - new iOS 26 design system
- **FoundationModels** - new on-device ML framework with structured generation macros
- **SwiftUI changes** - especially things that previously required view representables

If you can't find an implementation of something mentioned in the project, assume it's new API and use `DocumentationSearch` to find details.

### Validation Tools

Use these to verify your work without running a full build:

- `XcodeRefreshCodeIssuesInFile` - Fast (seconds) check for type errors, missing imports, hallucinated APIs. Use this frequently while editing.
- `ExecuteSnippet` - Run code in file context to test ideas. Faster than unit tests for quick experiments.
- `BuildProject` - Full build. Use to verify everything compiles correctly. Takes longer but catches linking and cross-file issues.


## Gemini API instructions

**Reference `GEMINI_API.md` for complete API documentation before modifying Gemini code.**

Key rules:
- Always set `temperature` to `1.0` in generationConfig (Gemini 3 requirement)
- Schema types must be lowercase: `string`, `object`, `array`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`
- Use `responseMimeType` and `responseSchema` for structured outputs
- Function responses use `functionResponse` with `name` and `response` fields
- Limit to 10-20 functions max for best accuracy


## Swift instructions

- Always mark `@Observable` classes with `@MainActor`.
- Assume strict Swift concurrency rules are being applied.
- **Avoid the Combine framework.** Prefer Swift's async/await APIs instead.
- Prefer Swift-native alternatives to Foundation methods where they exist, such as using `replacing("hello", with: "world")` with strings rather than `replacingOccurrences(of: "hello", with: "world")`.
- Prefer modern Foundation API, for example `URL.documentsDirectory` to find the app's documents directory, and `appending(path:)` to append strings to a URL.
- Never use C-style number formatting such as `Text(String(format: "%.2f", abs(myNumber)))`; always use `Text(abs(change), format: .number.precision(.fractionLength(2)))` instead.
- Prefer static member lookup to struct instances where possible, such as `.circle` rather than `Circle()`, and `.borderedProminent` rather than `BorderedProminentButtonStyle()`.
- Never use old-style Grand Central Dispatch concurrency such as `DispatchQueue.main.async()`. If behavior like this is needed, always use modern Swift concurrency.
- Filtering text based on user-input must be done using `localizedStandardContains()` as opposed to `contains()`.
- Avoid force unwraps and force `try` unless it is unrecoverable.


## SwiftUI instructions

- Always use `foregroundStyle()` instead of `foregroundColor()`.
- Always use `clipShape(.rect(cornerRadius:))` instead of `cornerRadius()`.
- Always use the `Tab` API instead of `tabItem()`.
- Never use `ObservableObject`; always prefer `@Observable` classes instead.
- Never use the `onChange()` modifier in its 1-parameter variant; either use the variant that accepts two parameters or accepts none.
- Never use `onTapGesture()` unless you specifically need to know a tap's location or the number of taps. All other usages should use `Button`.
- Never use `Task.sleep(nanoseconds:)`; always use `Task.sleep(for:)` instead.
- Never use `UIScreen.main.bounds` to read the size of the available space.
- Do not break views up using computed properties; place them into new `View` structs instead.
- Do not force specific font sizes; prefer using Dynamic Type instead.
- Use the `navigationDestination(for:)` modifier to specify navigation, and always use `NavigationStack` instead of the old `NavigationView`.
- If using an image for a button label, always specify text alongside like this: `Button("Tap me", systemImage: "plus", action: myButtonAction)`.
- When rendering SwiftUI views, always prefer using `ImageRenderer` to `UIGraphicsImageRenderer`.
- Don't apply the `fontWeight()` modifier unless there is good reason. If you want to make some text bold, always use `bold()` instead of `fontWeight(.bold)`.
- Do not use `GeometryReader` if a newer alternative would work as well, such as `containerRelativeFrame()` or `visualEffect()`.
- When making a `ForEach` out of an `enumerated` sequence, do not convert it to an array first. So, prefer `ForEach(x.enumerated(), id: \.element.id)` instead of `ForEach(Array(x.enumerated()), id: \.element.id)`.
- When hiding scroll view indicators, use the `.scrollIndicators(.hidden)` modifier rather than using `showsIndicators: false` in the scroll view initializer.
- Place view logic into view models or similar, so it can be tested.
- Avoid `AnyView` unless it is absolutely required.
- Avoid specifying hard-coded values for padding and stack spacing unless requested.
- Avoid using UIKit colors in SwiftUI code.


## SwiftData instructions

If SwiftData is configured to use CloudKit:

- Never use `@Attribute(.unique)`.
- Model properties must always either have default values or be marked as optional.
- All relationships must be marked optional.


## Project structure

- Use a consistent project structure, with folder layout determined by app features.
- Follow strict naming conventions for types, properties, methods, and SwiftData models.
- Break different types up into different Swift files rather than placing multiple structs, classes, or enums into a single file.
- Write unit tests for core application logic using the **Testing framework** (`import Testing`).
- Write UI tests using the **XCUIAutomation framework** when unit tests are not possible.
- Add code comments and documentation comments as needed.
- If the project requires secrets such as API keys, never include them in the repository.


## Modularity requirements

- **Files should not exceed ~300 lines.** If a file grows beyond this, refactor it by extracting components, helpers, or related code into separate files.
- **Views should be modular.** Extract reusable UI components (cards, rows, buttons, etc.) into their own files.
- **One primary type per file.** Each file should contain one main struct/class/enum, with small related extensions allowed.
- **Group related components.** Keep related UI components in the same feature folder (e.g., `Features/Dashboard/` contains `DashboardView.swift`, `DailyProgressCard.swift`, `MacroBreakdownCard.swift`).
- **Services should be focused.** If a service has multiple distinct responsibilities, consider splitting it into separate focused services.


## PR instructions

- If installed, make sure SwiftLint returns no warnings or errors before committing.
