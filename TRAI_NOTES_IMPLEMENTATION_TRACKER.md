## Progress Log
- 2026-02-07: Initialized tracker with baseline statuses from code audit.
- 2026-02-07: Started implementation of #3.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #3 by changing recent-workout ordering to sort by actual `Date` values (not formatted date strings) in `GeminiFunctionExecutor+PlanWorkout`.
- 2026-02-07: Build check still fails due pre-existing errors in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+PlanPipeline.swift` (missing `import os`), with no reported errors from the updated workout executor file.
- 2026-02-07: Started #4 by updating Live Activity progression logic in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/LiveWorkoutViewModel.swift` to advance based on logged set data/cardio completion rather than `set.completed`.
- 2026-02-07: Verified no compile errors reported for `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/LiveWorkoutViewModel.swift`; build still blocked by the same pre-existing `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+PlanPipeline.swift` errors.
- 2026-02-07: Updated Live Activity widget visuals in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/TraiWidgets/TraiWidgetsLiveActivity.swift` to use Trai’s existing symbol (`circle.hexagongrid.circle`) and app-aligned accent/neutral colors instead of the prior orange/green status styling.
- 2026-02-07: Verified no compile errors reported for `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/TraiWidgets/TraiWidgetsLiveActivity.swift`; build remains blocked by the same pre-existing `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+PlanPipeline.swift` errors.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #6 by making quick-add custom exercises inherit category/muscle context in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/ExerciseListView.swift`, including backfilling missing muscle group on matching existing strength custom exercises when context is available.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #11 by updating food image prompts in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiPromptBuilder.swift` and `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiChatPrompts.swift` to prioritize intended meal items and ignore incidental/background items.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #18 by removing muscle selector expansion gating in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/MuscleGroupSelector.swift`, allowing target-muscle edits mid-workout.
- 2026-02-07: Consolidated filtered build check reported no errors in updated files (`LiveWorkoutViewModel.swift`, `TraiWidgetsLiveActivity.swift`, `ExerciseListView.swift`, `GeminiPromptBuilder.swift`, `GeminiChatPrompts.swift`, `MuscleGroupSelector.swift`); build remains blocked by pre-existing `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+PlanPipeline.swift` errors.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #7 by normalizing target-muscle chip height in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/AddCustomExerciseSheet.swift` with a fixed minimum content height for each muscle chip.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #22 by tightening center-ring text scaling/constraints in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Dashboard/CalorieDetailSheet.swift` to prevent overflow for larger values.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #19 by adding PR highlights (weight/reps/volume vs prior history) to `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/WorkoutDetailSheet.swift`.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #20 symbol pass by replacing `circle.hexagongrid.circle` with `brain.head.profile` across Trai entry points (`ContentView`, `LiveWorkoutComponents`, widgets, and shortcuts) for a more coach-specific identity.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #4 Apple Watch/small-family Live Activity pass in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/TraiWidgets/TraiWidgetsLiveActivity.swift` by adding supplemental activity families and compact small-family presentation.
- 2026-02-07: Improved #15 by fixing chat non-response path for `log_weight` in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+FunctionCalling.swift` (added `log_weight` to fallback data-function summaries) and activity labeling in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatViewMessaging.swift`.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #5 with direct template-day editing controls in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/WorkoutPlanEditSheet.swift` (day focus presets like Push/Pull/Legs/Upper/Lower/Full Body/Core, per-day core toggle, and global “core in all workouts” toggle).
- 2026-02-07: Completed #21 by routing quick-start custom workouts through `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/CustomWorkoutSetupSheet.swift` from `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/WorkoutsView.swift`, so names default from selected muscle groups before workout start.
- 2026-02-07: Hardened #15 with a final safety fallback in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+FunctionCalling.swift` that always emits a local confirmation message after successful `log_weight` calls if model follow-up text is empty.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #17 by strengthening machine-photo prompt specificity in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+Exercise.swift` (explicit variant disambiguation and visible brand/model preference).
- 2026-02-07: Improved #2/#9 latency in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatViewMessaging.swift` by throttling streamed text UI updates to reduce re-render pressure during active responses.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #8 by tightening double-progression logic in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/WorkoutTemplateService.swift` to require rep-trigger completion across working set patterns (e.g., true `3x12`) before increasing weight.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #1 ordering pass in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/ExerciseListView.swift` with deterministic section ordering, target-muscle priority ordering, and recency-aware exercise ranking.
- 2026-02-07: Completed #10 in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Workouts/LiveWorkoutDetailSheet.swift` by adding edit-mode controls for warm-up toggles, add/remove sets, add/remove exercises, and history sync for added/removed entries.
- 2026-02-07: Further improved #15 reliability by adding explicit weight-tool routing guidance in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+FunctionCallingHelpers.swift` and hardening `log_weight` argument parsing/date normalization in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiFunctionExecutor+PlanWorkout.swift`.
- 2026-02-07: Focused build check reported no errors for updated files (`WorkoutTemplateService.swift`, `ExerciseListView.swift`, `LiveWorkoutDetailSheet.swift`); build remains blocked by pre-existing `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+PlanPipeline.swift` (`import os` missing) errors.
- 2026-02-07: Additional #2/#9 latency pass in chat (`/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatInputBar.swift`, `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatView.swift`, `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatViewMessaging.swift`, `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatMessageViews.swift`) by isolating input draft state from the parent view and caching formatted AI markdown paragraphs to reduce typing/interaction re-render pressure.
- 2026-02-07: Removed the pre-existing build blocker by adding `import os` in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+PlanPipeline.swift`; project build now succeeds (`xcodebuild ... Trai`).
- 2026-02-07: Hardened #15 `log_weight` parsing in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiFunctionExecutor+PlanWorkout.swift` to accept integer/string values, infer units from strings like `"182 lbs"`, and fall back to profile unit preference when unit is omitted; updated `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiFunctionDeclarations.swift` to only require `weight`.
- 2026-02-07: Additional #2/#9 render-path cleanup in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatContentList.swift` by pre-filtering visible messages once before `ForEach` to reduce repeated branching work during updates.
- 2026-02-07: Full project build remains green after latest changes (`** BUILD SUCCEEDED **`).
- 2026-02-07: Additional #2/#9 stream-path optimization in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatViewMessaging.swift` by replacing per-chunk delayed task churn with direct 50ms render gating.
- 2026-02-07: Additional #15 safety in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+FunctionCalling.swift` to emit explicit fallback error text when `log_weight` fails and the model returns no follow-up message.
- 2026-02-07: Added quick no-response fallback for direct weight-entry messages in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Core/Services/GeminiService+FunctionCalling.swift` to execute `log_weight` when the model returns no function/text, and marked #15 as DONE.
- 2026-02-07: Runtime smoke check completed on iOS simulator (`iPhone 16e`) by building, installing, launching, and confirming the app process stayed alive for 5s before explicit termination.
- 2026-02-07: Additional #2/#9 optimization by rendering the actively streaming AI bubble as plain text (skip markdown parsing until stream completion) in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatContentList.swift` and `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatMessageViews.swift`.
- 2026-02-07: Additional #2/#9 optimization in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatContentList.swift` + `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatMessageViews.swift` to limit text selection to the most recent AI messages, reducing interaction overhead in long chat histories.
- 2026-02-07: Additional #2/#9 optimization in `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatMessageViews.swift` + `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai/Features/Chat/ChatContentList.swift` to restrict heavy state animations to the newest visible message only, reducing update overhead in long threads.
