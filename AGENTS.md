# AGENTS.md

## Purpose
- Shared operating notes for coding agents working in this repository.

## Project Scope
- App code: `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai`
- Widgets: `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/TraiWidgets`
- Xcode project: `/Users/nadav/Desktop/Trai/Trai.xcodeproj`

## Working Rules
- Make targeted, minimal changes.
- Preserve existing architecture and naming conventions.
- Run a focused build/test check after edits when possible.
- Do not revert unrelated local changes.

## Validation
- Prefer project-level build checks for modified Swift files.
- If full build is expensive, run the smallest check that still validates compile safety.
