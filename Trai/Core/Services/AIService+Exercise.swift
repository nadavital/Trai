            Analyze this exercise and provide details about it.

            Exercise name: "\(name)"

            Determine:
            1. Category: Choose the broad behavior fallback from strength, cardio, conditioning, mobility, skill, sportPractice, recovery, flexibility, or custom.
            2. activityTypeName: Choose the user-facing activity type, such as Climbing, Cycling, Running, Mobility Flow, Boxing, Basketball, or Strength.
            3. activityAliases: Common names Trai should treat as the same activity type, when useful.
            4. Primary muscle group for strength exercises only: chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps, legs, core, or fullBody.
            5. Secondary muscles worked, when relevant.
            6. Target tags that describe what the user is training with this exercise.
            7. Tracking fields the user should see while logging it.
            8. A brief 1-sentence description of the exercise.
            9. Optional quick form or execution tip.

            Use these tracking fields only: sets, reps, weight, duration, distance, notes.
            Pick fields that match how the exercise is actually tracked. For example:
            - Strength usually tracks sets, weight, and reps.
            - Running usually tracks duration and distance.
            - Mobility usually tracks duration and notes.
            - Conditioning may track duration, reps, and notes.
            - Skill practice may track duration, reps, and notes.

            Return targetTags as concise user-facing labels, not internal jargon. Do not use calories.
            If you don't recognize the exercise, make your best educated guess based on the name.

            Look at this image related to gym equipment or an exercise machine.

            - part of the machine
            - an instruction placard or diagram
            - a brand/model label

            2. What exercises can be done with it (list 2-4 main exercises)

            \(existingExercisesContext)
            IMPORTANT:
            - Use any visible text, diagrams, labels, or setup instructions in the image to help identify the equipment.
            - Prioritize what is clearly visible in the image over guessing.
            - Do NOT invent hidden attachments, stations, exercise variants, or machine names that are not supported by the visible image.
            - If the image only shows a partial view or descriptive signage, use the visible clues but keep the answer generic if needed instead of forcing a highly specific machine name.
            - Be specific when similar machines exist, but only when the image supports that level of certainty.
            - If brand/model text is clearly visible on the machine, include that in equipmentName (e.g., "Life Fitness Seated Row Machine").
            - For each suggested exercise, include category, activityTypeName, activityAliases, muscleGroup when it is strength, targetTags, and trackingFields so the app can save it correctly.
            - Categories are broad fallback behaviors and must be one of: strength, cardio, conditioning, mobility, skill, sportPractice, recovery, flexibility, custom.
            - activityTypeName is the user-facing identity and can be specific, such as Climbing, Cycling, Running, Mobility Flow, Boxing, Basketball, or Strength.
            - Tracking fields must be chosen from: sets, reps, weight, duration, distance, notes. Do not use calories.
            - Strength machine exercises usually track sets, weight, and reps. Cardio machines usually track duration and distance. Skill or mobility suggestions usually track duration and notes.
            - If the image is too unclear to confidently identify gym equipment, return:
              equipmentName: "Unclear gym equipment"
              suggestedExercises: []
              description: "The image does not clearly show identifiable gym equipment."
              tips: "Retake the photo with the full machine, placard, or visible labels."
            - If the image is not gym equipment, do not force it into a gym machine category. Use a generic visible label, keep suggestedExercises empty unless they are clearly supported by the object shown, and explain the uncertainty in description or tips.
